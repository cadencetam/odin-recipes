This is the Foundation Project, "PROJECT: RECIPES" on the Odin Project.
The aim of this project is to practice all of the HTML skills I have learnt so far on The Odin Project.
In the future, CSS will be added to this project for further practice.
I will return to this markdown file upon project completion for a reflection.
