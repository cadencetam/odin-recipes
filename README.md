This is my submission of the assignment, "PROJECT: RECIPES" as part of the Odin Project Foundations curriculum.
The aim of this project is to practice all of the HTML skills I have learnt so far on The Odin Project.
In the future, CSS will be added to this project for further practice.
I will return to this markdown file upon project completion for a reflection.
